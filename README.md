A fork of [tanstack basic example](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/examples/basic)

Made to demo a case where tanstack devtools shows unsplash api call has been cached, but the browser keeps fetching the api everytime the component mounts
Along side is a 'posts' api which behaves as expected
